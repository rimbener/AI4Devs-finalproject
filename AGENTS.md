# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Code agents when working with code in this repository.
In all interactions, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Project

AI Study Buddy — AI4Devs bootcamp final project. Turns an uploaded PDF into an AI-generated lesson of alternating instructional and activity slides (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, flashcards, etc.). Product spec lives in `PRD.md`; `readme.md` is the course deliverable template (Spanish) to be filled in for submission.

Canonical agent rules live in `.agents/rules/` and take precedence:
- `global.mdc` — monorepo spec (folders, libs, naming, tooling, Supabase)
- `hooks-service-dao.mdc` — hook/service/DAO layering (read before adding hooks, services, or DAOs)
- `atomic-design.mdc` — component structure methodology
- `component-split.mdc` — UI co-location split (tsx / types / hook / helpers) for non-trivial components
- `state.mdc` — ≥3 related local states that change together → `useReducer`
- `state-sharing.mdc` — React Context to avoid deep / large prop-drilling
- `e2e.mdc` — Playwright e2e are interaction-only (no render-only presence tests)

Brand/design system (colors, type, voice, MD3 foundations, token↔repo mapping): `.agents/DESIGN.md`.

## Commands

pnpm workspaces + Turborepo (workspaces declared in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; internal `@helsoft/*` deps use the `workspace:*` protocol). Run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev           # turbo run dev (app + storybooks)
pnpm build         # turbo run build
pnpm lint          # turbo run lint (Biome per workspace: biome check .)
pnpm format        # biome check --write . (fix format + safe lint + import order repo-wide)
pnpm check-types   # turbo run check-types (tsc --noEmit per workspace)
pnpm clean         # remove node_modules/.turbo/dist/.expo everywhere + watchman
```

Target a single workspace:

```bash
pnpm --filter app-study-buddy dev         # Expo dev server (also: web / ios / android)
pnpm --filter @helsoft/components dev     # Storybook on port 6007 (lib-with-storybook: 6006, study-buddy: 6008, activities: 6009, logging-in-out: 6010)
pnpm turbo run check-types --filter=@helsoft/supabase-services
pnpm turbo run check-types --filter=@helsoft/services
```

Lint/format is Biome (root `biome.jsonc`: single quotes, 2-space indent, lineWidth 100; version pinned via the pnpm catalog in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). ESLint/Prettier are not used. Rule deviations live in `biome.jsonc` with a comment (e.g. `noStaticOnlyClass` off — DAO/Service classes are static by design); one-off suppressions use `// biome-ignore <rule>: <reason>`.

There is a `test` turbo task but no workspace defines a `test` script yet — no test runner is installed. When adding one, wire the workspace's `test` script so `pnpm test` picks it up.

pnpm blocks dependency build scripts by default; if an install reports ignored builds, approve the package in the `allowBuilds` section of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

Supabase (hosted project, linked via `supabase/`):

```bash
npx supabase migration new <name>   # schema changes go through migrations
npx supabase db push
```

## Architecture

Turborepo monorepo with three top-level areas:

- **`apps/app-study-buddy`** — universal Expo app (SDK 57, Expo Router, React Native 0.86, React 19; ships web + iOS + Android from one codebase). App code stays minimal — screens in `src/app/` (file-based routing) should mostly compose from libs. **Expo SDK 57 changed significantly: consult https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing Expo code** (see `apps/app-study-buddy/AGENTS.md`).
- **`libs/*`** — all shared/business code, published as `@helsoft/*` workspace packages: `js-utils` (pure, platform-agnostic TypeScript utilities; see its `AGENTS.md`), `rn-utils` (React Native-specific TypeScript utilities; no components/hooks; see its `AGENTS.md`), `types` (plain TS types, one `type-name.ts` file each), `components` (shared UI + Storybook stories, atomic design), `activities` (activity-slide organisms — multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, flashcard, matching, open-ended, etc.; Storybook + Jest + Playwright + Stryker like `components`, depends on `components` for shared atoms/molecules/theme), `logging-in-out` (prop-driven login/logout organisms — LoginForm, SignInForm, SignOut; Storybook on 6010; no useAuth/router), `hooks`, `services` (non-Supabase services + DAOs: REST/`fetch`, AsyncStorage, etc.), `supabase-services` (Supabase services + DAOs + client), `study-buddy` (the app's feature lib — business logic for the app lives here, not in the app), `lib-with-storybook` (template for new Storybook-enabled libs; copy its story patterns).
- **`supabase/`** — backend is Supabase (auth, Postgres, storage, edge functions). CLI config and migrations only.

### Data-flow layering (enforced — see `hooks-service-dao.mdc`; local related state → `state.mdc`; shared across a subtree → `state-sharing.mdc`)

```
Component → Hook → Service → DAO → Supabase / external API
```

Two service libs — pick by data source:

- **`@helsoft/services`** — non-Supabase DAOs/services (`fetch`, AsyncStorage, etc.). Paths: `libs/services/src/dao|services/{feature}.{dao|service}.ts`.
- **`@helsoft/supabase-services`** — Supabase DAOs/services + `initSupabase`/`getSupabase`. Paths: `libs/supabase-services/src/dao|services/{feature}.{dao|service}.ts`.
- **DAOs** (`{Feature}Dao` abstract class, static methods): raw data access only. One DAO class per data source.
- **Services** (`{Feature}Service` abstract class): validation + business logic; call DAOs, never fetch directly; no React.
- **Hooks** (`libs/hooks/src/hooks/use-{feature}.ts`): React integration wrapping services (never DAOs directly). tanstack-query is the intended pattern for data-fetching hooks but is not installed yet — add it to `@helsoft/hooks` when first needed. Related local state ≥3 fields → `useReducer` (`state.mdc`). Deep / large prop-drilling → React Context (`state-sharing.mdc`).
- Each layer exports through its `index.ts` barrel files.

### Supabase client wiring

`initSupabase()`/`getSupabase()` live in `@helsoft/supabase-services` (not `@helsoft/services`). The app initializes the client at startup in `apps/app-study-buddy/src/lib/supabase.ts` from `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (copy `apps/app-study-buddy/.env.example` to `.env`). Anything in libs just calls `getSupabase()` — it throws if init was skipped. Session state comes from `useSession()` in `@helsoft/hooks`.

## Conventions

- Functional React only; no Redux. Always declare a Props type for components.
- Kebab-case filenames: `component-name/component-name.tsx` (+ `component-name.stories.tsx` for every shared component), `{feature}.dao.ts`, `{feature}.service.ts`, `use-{feature}.ts`.
- Platform-specific files use the `.web.tsx` suffix convention (see `apps/app-study-buddy/src/components/`).
- New apps `app-{feature}` should pair with a feature lib `libs/{feature}`.

## Agentic orchestrator

Feature work runs through a gated agentic orchestrator. To build a feature from a user story:

```
/ticket-orchestrator <story>        # story = a file in user-stories/pending/<story>.md (moved → in-progress → done as it runs)
```

The pipeline: `spec_partner` (**plan mode**: grill read-only → present plan) → **one human gate** (approve the plan) → `spec_partner` authors the bundle → `spec_reviewer` (1 round) → `implementer` (strict TDD, vertical slices; per-slice `reviewer_slice` 1 round: all `.agents/rules/` + design + a11y) → `reviews_lead` (full review: CI once + sole `reviewer_engineering` — code · architecture · performance · security) → `mutation_tester` (StrykerJS once after full review) → `dod_validator` (Definition of Done). All state lives in `docs/features/<name>/`; session state in `progress/`.

**Source of truth: `.agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md`.** Roles in `.agents/agents/` (each reviewer carries its own rubric), TDD + code rules in `.agents/rules/`, skills in `.agents/skills/`, templates in `.agents/templates/`. Full design + rationale: `/ORCHESTRATOR_PLAN.md`.
