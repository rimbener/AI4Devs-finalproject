# Run StrykerJS scoped to a feature's CHANGED source files, per lib.
#
# Usage:
#   run-mutation.sh [base-ref]      # base-ref defaults to "main"
#
# Computes files changed since the merge-base with base-ref via three-dot
# (`git diff A...B` ≡ `git diff $(merge-base A B) B`). Required for the
# default base (`main`) so only this branch's changes are included; when
# base-ref is an ancestor of HEAD, this equals two-dot `A..B`. Filters to
# each lib's mutate-able source (excludes tests, stories, e2e, and index
# barrels), and runs `stryker run --mutate` for each affected lib. Never
# runs a whole-repo mutation.
